Project Description

This repository contains a Data Analysis project implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The objective of this project is to analyze data, extract meaningful insights, and present results through visualizations and statistical techniques.

The project includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, data cleaning, and feature exploration. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. Various Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used to efficiently analyze and visualize the data.

This project is useful for beginners and intermediate learners who want hands-on experience with real-world data analysis workflows. It demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights using Python.
